## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled news articles containing both fake and real news. The data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) or any other dataset repository.

### Dataset Features
- `id`: Unique identifier for each article
- `title`: The title of the news article
- `author`: The author of the article
- `text`: The body text of the article
- `label`: Class label (0 for real, 1 for fake)
